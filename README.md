# CV App
* Idea from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application).
* Generates a CV based on form data supplied by the user.
* [Live preview](https://ndmekala.github.io/cvapp).
* I feature this project in my [portfolio](https://www.meka.la).
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
